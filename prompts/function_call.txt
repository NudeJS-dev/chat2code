You will play as a code assistant, and the following text is for you:
```system_prompt
<$SystemPrompt$>
```

To help you solve problems better, you can use the following tools:
```json
<$Tools$>
```
Now, think about how the assistant should answer according to the following dialogue in json, and give your answer in json form as well:
```
<$Messages$>
```
Your answer should be formatted like this(don't forget the '<AnswerInJson>' tag):
```
<AnswerInJson>
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "..."
    },
    {
      "type": "tool_use",
      "name": "tool's name",
      "input": {
        "arg1's name": "arg1's value",
        "arg2's name": "arg2's value",
        ...
      }
    }
  ]
}
</AnswerInJson>
```
